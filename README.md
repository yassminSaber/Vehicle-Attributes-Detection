# vehicle-attributes-detection
1.	Build a web application for the government to upload a vehicleâ€™s video and give the needed traffic violation with abnormal behavior vehicles, and for the driver to inquire about his traffic violation.
2.	YOLov8 tracking was used to track the vehicles and detects thier types
3.	Training custom dataset on YOLOv8 for plate number detection
4.	KNN was used for color detection
5.	Pre-trained model was used for damage status detection
6.	Results of tracking was used to calculate the speed for each vehicle
